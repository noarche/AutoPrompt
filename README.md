# ÍßÅÍßÇ üîÆAutoPrompt
### Over 100 billion unique prompt possibilities. 

*Actual number is closer to 8.254‚àó10^35*

 Chances of two people generating the same prompt is low/slim!

Create random prompts to help with learning how to generate AI art.


To Generate a prompt place a check in the boxes. 
Think of these boxes as containers with a bunch of random prompts.
The final prompt will be combined with a comma inbetween
the random strings pulled from the boxes,
You do not need to change check boxes to get a new random
prompt. 

More checkboxs selected = longer prompt. This doesnt nessacarily mean a higher quality outcome. 

Use this app and try to find your sweet spot keywords to build your own prompts. 

Compatible will all image generation platforms!! Paste the prompt into your favorite Al-image gen. platform. *If you are not running a local model using comfyui or A1111 or forge stay away from the erotic and uncensored checkboxes!*

### üçÄBonus Prompts:

Feeling lucky? Leave all the boxes empty and press Generate for a random yet complete prompt that someone else has used to make a pretty cool image!

## üü¢Is this a virus‚ùî

No it is not a virus, that is a false positive. Anything compiled with pyinstaller will be flagged as potentially malicious. Pyinstaller is what turns the .py file into a .exe file and allows people to run python scripts as portable applications without the need to install python or any dependancies.  

Please scan the actual source, the file that ends with '.py' -  It will with no doubt be 100% clean on virustotal.  That being said I have provided instructions on how to build your own exe from the file you know is clean. 

‚òëÔ∏èTip for all questionable applications: 

*Running the application via [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) or similar app will virutalize and protect your OS as if it was running on a virtual machine - [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie-plus.com/downloads/) can be used with any application or installation package thus another great tool to have.*
